# Installation of the  Models tested with the Method for Long Text Similarity
The method is implemented on several language models, based on the features  of each model, the method can be customized for using  GPU or CPU only processuing. Currently the  method  tested with the following  language models:
1.- Sentence Transformers
2.- LongFormer
3.- BigBird
4.- BART
5.- GPT2

## 1.- Implementation on Sentence Transformers 
### Dependencies


## 2.- Implementation on LongFormer  
  Python Version 3.10.11 
### Dependencies
 * transformers
 * LongformerModel
 * LongformerTokenizer

# Preprocessing of texts 
Prior the assessment of similarity  the documents are splitted either in sentences or chunks with fixed size

# Comparison of a pairs of texts

# Systematic Comparison
