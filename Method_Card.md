# Method Card
This blended  method for text similarity consists of an analytical  stategy that decomposes two texts into  sentences or chunks  and test the similarity between pairs of sentences or chunks to establish the similarity of two documents. The method has been implemented in the following models:

1.- Sentence transformers: all_MiniLM-L6-v2, all_MiniLM-L12-v2, all_mpnet-base-v2, glove.300D

2.- Large language models: LongFormer, GPT2, BigBird and BART

In order to  install the proposed method with each model  please refer to [Quick Start](Quick_Start.md)
